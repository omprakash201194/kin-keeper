# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Kin-Keeper

An AI-powered family document vault. Users sign in with Google, store document metadata in Firebase/Firestore, and files in their own Google Drive. A chat interface powered by Claude (BYOK — user provides their own API key) lets users upload, search, and organize documents through natural language.

## Architecture

```
Browser (React + TS + Vite)
   ├── Auth: Firebase Auth (Google OAuth)
   └── All data: through Spring Boot REST API
            │
            ├── Metadata: Firestore
            ├── Files: Google Drive (per-user, via OAuth tokens)
            └── AI Chat: Claude API (tool use, user's own key)
```

Everything goes through the Spring Boot backend — no direct Firestore or Drive access from the frontend. The backend validates Firebase ID tokens on every request, then proxies to Firestore/Drive/Claude as needed.

**Family model:** One user is the family admin. All documents go to the admin's Google Drive. Invited family members (other Google accounts) see the same data with role-based access (admin/viewer).

**BYOK AI:** Each user stores their own Claude API key (encrypted in Firestore). The backend uses it for tool-use chat — Claude decides which tools to call (search docs, upload, recategorize), the backend executes them, returns results to Claude for a final response. No API key = app works in manual mode only.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Spring Boot 3.4.4, Java 21, Maven |
| Cache | Redis (shared homelab instance at `redis.homelab.svc.cluster.local:6379`) |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (Google provider) |
| Metadata DB | Firestore (no local DB) |
| File Storage | Google Drive (user's own account) |
| AI | Claude API via Anthropic Java SDK (tool use) |

## Build & Run

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
mvn compile                    # compile
mvn spring-boot:run            # run (port 8080)
mvn package -DskipTests        # build jar
mvn test                       # run tests
```
Requires env vars: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` (path to Firebase service account JSON).

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install                    # install deps
npm run dev                    # dev server (port 5173, proxies /api to :8080)
npm run build                  # production build
npx tsc --noEmit               # type check only
```
Requires `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`): `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`.

### Docker
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && docker build -t homelab/kin-keeper-backend:1.0.0 .

# Frontend
cd frontend && docker build -t homelab/kin-keeper-frontend:1.0.0 .
```

## Subject model

Documents, reminders, and conversations can link to any number of "subjects" via
`LinkRef = {type, id}` where `type` is one of: `MEMBER`, `CONTACT`, `HOME`, `VEHICLE`,
`APPLIANCE`, `POLICY`, `DOCUMENT`, `CONVERSATION`, `PLAN`. A single entity may link to several
subjects at once — e.g. car insurance links both the policyholder `MEMBER` and the
`VEHICLE` asset; a lawyer-call conversation links both the `CONTACT` lawyer and the
`HOME` asset it's about.

For backward compatibility `Document.memberId` stays as the "primary member link"; new
uploads populate both `memberId` and an entry in `links[]`. Reads that filter by
`memberId` continue to work; multi-subject reads should iterate `links`.

Assets are a unified entity with a `type` discriminator — only fields relevant to each
type are populated:
  - **HOME**:       `name`, `address`, `purchaseDate`, `ownerMemberIds`, `notes`
  - **VEHICLE**:    `name`, `make`, `model`, `identifier` (reg/VIN), `purchaseDate`,
                    `odometerKm`, `ownerMemberIds`, `notes`
  - **APPLIANCE**:  `name`, `make`, `model`, `identifier` (serial), `purchaseDate`,
                    `expiryDate` (warranty end), `ownerMemberIds`, `notes`
  - **POLICY**:     `name`, `provider`, `identifier` (policy #), `purchaseDate` (start),
                    `expiryDate` (end), `frequency`, `amount` (premium),
                    `ownerMemberIds` (insureds), `linkedAssetIds` (covered assets).
                    **POLICY is deliberately broad** — it covers insurance
                    policies AND recurring subscriptions/services (internet, gas,
                    electricity, phone recharge, credit card statements, OTT,
                    rent). The UI labels it "Policies & Subscriptions" and the
                    agent auto-files pasted bill/SMS messages under this type.
                    `expiryDate` is used for both policy-end and next-renewal-
                    due-date; reminders anchor on it with recurrence set to the
                    billing cycle.

Reminders support date-based recurrence (`NONE`/`DAILY`/`WEEKLY`/`MONTHLY`/`QUARTERLY`/
`HALF_YEARLY`/`YEARLY`) and an `ODOMETER` type for vehicle servicing (uses
`dueOdometerKm` + `recurrenceIntervalKm` against a linked `VEHICLE`). Every reminder
must be anchored to at least one asset (`HOME`/`VEHICLE`/`APPLIANCE`/`POLICY`) **or** a
`CONVERSATION` — floating reminders tied only to members/contacts/documents are
rejected by the service.

Plans are time-bounded things the family is organizing — trips, concerts, weddings.
Each plan carries an itinerary of `segments` (flight/hotel/activity/concert/meal/
transport/other) and a polymorphic `links` list for attendees (MEMBER/CONTACT),
attached documents (tickets, bookings), and related assets. Map view is deferred —
see `ROADMAP.md`.

Conversations are a ledger of real-world interactions — calls, visits, meetings, email
threads. Two formats:
  - **ENCOUNTER**: single-entry recap with `summary`, `outcome`, `followUp`. Good for
    "called Dr K, continue meds two more weeks, follow up Oct 3".
  - **THREAD**: verbatim list of `messages` (each `{from, content, at}`). Good for
    negotiations you want to replay later.

Conversations carry `links` like any other subject-aware entity — a conversation can
link to multiple subjects (a lawyer contact AND a home asset AND a specific document)
simultaneously. When an ENCOUNTER carries a `followUp`, the UI and chat agent both
offer to spawn a reminder anchored on that conversation.

## Auth Flow

1. Frontend: `signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider)` → Firebase ID token
2. Frontend: axios interceptor attaches `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` to every `/api/*` request
3. Backend: `FirebaseAuthFilter` verifies token via Firebase Admin SDK, sets `FirebaseUserPrincipal` in SecurityContext
4. Controllers access the principal via `@AuthenticationPrincipal FirebaseUserPrincipal`

## Conventions

Follows the parent HomeLab CLAUDE.md conventions:
- Constructor injection only, `@Slf4j` for logging, `application.yml` for config
- `ResponseEntity<?>` for all controller returns
- `@ConfigurationProperties` for externalised config
- shadcn/ui components use `@/` path alias (mapped in tsconfig + vite config)
- shadcn/ui components added via: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>` (only `button` is scaffolded so far)
